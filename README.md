# CreativeCommonsCatPictures
Work in progress. There'll be a point to this, I promise.

-----------------------------------------


### Deploy Site Container
Container hosted [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/alexhaydock/cccp/).

```
docker run --cap-drop=all --name cccp -p 80:8080 -d alexhaydock/cccp
```

-----------------------------------------


### Deploy Tor Hidden Service Container
Tor Hidden Service deployed using [this container](https://github.com/alexhaydock/TorHiddenService-Docker/). It is a container that wraps Tor and nginx together, with nginx running in reverse-proxy mode. This is useful, as nginx can be configured to add in some useful headers that secure the onion service somewhat - and to strip out some headers that might give away too much about our server.
```
docker run --cap-drop=all --name cccptor -v /home/cats/nginx.conf/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro -v /home/cats/hiddenservice:/opt/onion/hiddenservice -d alexhaydock/onion
```
If you wish to deploy a site in a similar fashion, please see the `README.md` document in the repository for the container linked above.
